A linux tool for simple usage of the MSR605 magnet stripe reader/writer


USAGE:

    ./msrtool.py /dev/ttyUSB0


You should have write access to the serial port, so you either run this as
root or add yourself to the dialout group (or whatever group your linux
assigns /dev/ttyUSB0 to).

This is heavily based on the work from Damien Bobillot, who wrote the Python
driver for the MSR605's serial interface. I only wrapped a nicer frontend around.

As Damien's work is GPL, this is licensed under the terms of the GPL, too.

setup.sh will create a virtualenv and install the dependencies in the virtual enviornment

run.sh will activate the virtualenv and run the program inside the virtualenv
